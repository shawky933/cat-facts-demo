My attempt to learn react.

Just one page that fetches a random cat fact and presents it.

If you want to see it live: [https://cat-facts-demo.vercel.app/cat](https://cat-facts-demo.vercel.app/cat)

To run it locally:

Dev:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Prod:
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
